//Double ended queue
//deque(usually pronounced like "deck") is an irregular acronym double-ended queue
//double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends

//they provid a functionality similar to vectors, but with efficient insertion and deletion of elements also 
  at the beginning of the sequence, and not only at its end
