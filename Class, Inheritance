//a class can be derived from more than one classes, which means it can inherit
  data and functions from multiple base classes
//to define a derived class, we use a class derivation list to specify the base class
//where access-specifier is one of public, protected, or private,  and base-class is 
  the name of a previously defined class
//Constructors, destructors, nonmember functions, assignment operator, and 
  virtual methods are not inherited
